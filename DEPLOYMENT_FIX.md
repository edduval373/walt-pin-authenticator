# Railway Deployment Fix - INVALID_STATE Error Resolution

## Issue Identified
The Railway deployment failed with "INVALID_STATE" error due to conflicting build configurations between `railway.json` and `nixpacks.toml`.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Configuration Conflict
- **Before:** `railway.json` specified `buildCommand: "node railway-build.js"` while `nixpacks.toml` specified `npm run build`
- **After:** Unified configuration with `nixpacks.toml` handling the build command

### 2. Updated Files

**railway.json** (simplified):
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "npm start",
    "healthcheckPath": "/healthz",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 100,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```

**nixpacks.toml** (updated):
```toml
[variables]
NODE_ENV = "production"

[phases.build]
cmd = "node railway-build.js"

[start]
cmd = "npm start"
```

### 3. Build Process Verification
- Railway will now use `nixpacks.toml` exclusively for build configuration
- The `railway-build.js` script builds both client and server components
- No conflicting build commands

## Expected Deployment Flow

1. **Build Phase:** Railway runs `node railway-build.js`
   - Builds React client to `client/dist/`
   - Builds server TypeScript to `dist/index.js`
   
2. **Start Phase:** Railway runs `npm start`
   - Starts production server on assigned port
   - Serves static client files from `client/dist/`
   - Provides API endpoints for pin authentication

3. **Health Check:** Railway checks `/healthz` endpoint
   - Returns JSON status response
   - Confirms service is operational

## Deployment Status
✅ Configuration conflicts resolved
✅ Build process unified
✅ Health check endpoint configured
✅ Ready for re-deployment

## Next Steps
1. Attempt Railway deployment again
2. Monitor build logs for any remaining issues
3. Verify application loads after deployment
4. Test pin authentication functionality

The INVALID_STATE error should now be resolved with the unified build configuration.
