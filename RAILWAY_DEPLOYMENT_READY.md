# Disney Pin Authenticator - Railway Deployment Ready

## Status: ✅ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

**Date:** July 13, 2025
**Version:** Working backup restored from June 2025
**Status:** All systems operational - ready for Railway Git deployment

## Current Configuration

### Working Features Confirmed:
- ✅ React app loads properly
- ✅ Camera functionality working
- ✅ API integration with master.pinauth.com successful
- ✅ Pin authentication working (85% authenticity scores)
- ✅ Database connection established
- ✅ No user acceptance/feedback complications
- ✅ Simple "Disney Pin Checker" interface

### Railway Configuration Files:
- `railway.json` - Deployment configuration
- `nixpacks.toml` - Build configuration
- `railway-build.js` - Custom build script
- `Procfile` - Process configuration

### Required Environment Variables:
- `MOBILE_API_KEY` - For master.pinauth.com API access
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection (Railway provides)
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production"

## Build Process

### 1. Client Build:
```bash
cd client && npm run build
```
- Builds React app to `client/dist/`
- Uses Vite for optimized production build
- Includes all necessary assets and chunks

### 2. Server Build:
```bash
npm run build
```
- Compiles TypeScript server to `dist/index.js`
- Bundles dependencies using esbuild
- Creates production-ready server

### 3. Start Command:
```bash
npm start
```
- Runs `NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js`
- Serves React app from `client/dist/`
- Provides API endpoints for pin authentication

## Git Deployment Steps

1. **Commit Current State:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Restore working Disney Pin Authenticator from June backup"
   ```

2. **Push to Railway:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Railway Auto-Deploy:**
   - Railway will detect the push
   - Run `railway-build.js` to build both client and server
   - Deploy using `npm start`
   - Health check endpoint: `/healthz`

## Health Check Endpoint

The app provides a health check at `/healthz` that returns:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "disney-pin-authenticator",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-13T12:40:00.000Z"
}
```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main React app
- `POST /api/proxy/mobile-upload` - Pin authentication
- `GET /healthz` - Health check
- `GET /api/status` - API status

## Success Indicators

### Development (Current):
- Server running on port 5000
- Vite dev server with hot reloading
- Railway database connection successful
- API authentication working

### Production (Expected):
- Server running on Railway assigned port
- Static files served from `client/dist/`
- Production database connection
- API authentication working

## Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails:
1. Check `railway-build.js` output
2. Verify client build in `client/dist/`
3. Verify server build in `dist/`

### If Deployment Fails:
1. Check Railway logs for errors
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Check health check endpoint response

### If App Doesn't Load:
1. Verify static file serving from `client/dist/`
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify API endpoints are responding

## Recovery Instructions

If deployment fails, restore from this configuration:
1. Reset to current working state
2. Re-run build process
3. Verify all files are present
4. Re-deploy to Railway

---

**Summary:** The Disney Pin Authenticator is now in a working state with proper Railway deployment configuration. The app has been restored to the June 2025 backup version that was working before the user acceptance system complications. Ready for Git deployment to Railway.
