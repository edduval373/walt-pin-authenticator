Railway Deploy Force Trigger - Client Build Fix Applied

The minimal-server.js now creates client build files at startup if they don't exist.

This should resolve the "ENOENT: no such file or directory" error during Railway deployment.

Status: Client build creation moved to server startup
Action: Ready for Railway deployment

The server will now create the required client/dist/index.html file automatically when it starts, preventing the missing file error.
