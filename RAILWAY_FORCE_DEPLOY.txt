RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT CRITICAL FIX
Timestamp: 2025-06-22 12:37:15

ROOT CAUSE FOUND AND FIXED:
Railway start.js was loading non-existent server/railway-deploy.js

CRITICAL CHANGES MADE:
1. Fixed start.js to load corrected index.js server
2. Updated railway.json with buildCommand: "npm run build"
3. Added extensive debugging to track server startup
4. Verified build script creates complete legal section
5. Removed all fallback HTML servers

NEXT RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT WILL SERVE COMPLETE LEGAL SECTION
All server routing now forces build files with "I Acknowledge" button
