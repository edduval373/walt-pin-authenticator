# Railway Deployment Fix - July 12, 2025

## Issue
GitHub Actions deployment to Railway is failing with authentication error:
- Error: `unexpected argument '--token'` 
- Railway CLI command syntax has changed

## Solution
Updated `.github/workflows/railway-deploy.yml` to use environment variable authentication:

**Before:**
```bash
railway login --token $RAILWAY_TOKEN
railway link --project "PIM Authentication Library" --environment "Production"
railway up --service pinauth-mobile-pin
```

**After:**
```bash
railway up --service pinauth-mobile-pin
```

The Railway CLI automatically uses the RAILWAY_TOKEN environment variable when set, eliminating the need for explicit login commands in CI/CD environments.

## Status
- ✅ Fixed GitHub Actions workflow
- ✅ Updated authentication method for Railway CLI
- ✅ Added proper build step to create client/dist files
- ✅ Deployment should now work correctly

## Railway Configuration Required
**IMPORTANT**: Enable "Wait for CI" in Railway settings:
- This ensures Railway waits for GitHub Actions to complete successfully
- Prevents Railway from deploying before the build process finishes
- Allows GitHub Actions to handle the deployment via Railway CLI

## Next Steps
1. **Enable "Wait for CI" in Railway dashboard** (as shown in screenshot)
2. Commit and push the updated workflow file
3. GitHub Actions will build and deploy to Railway
4. pinauth.com should receive the proper build files
