# Railway Deployment Fix - July 12, 2025

## Issue
GitHub Actions deployment to Railway is failing with authentication error:
- Error: `unexpected argument '--token'` 
- Railway CLI command syntax has changed

## Solution
Updated `.github/workflows/railway-deploy.yml` to use the correct Railway CLI authentication:

**Before:**
```bash
railway login --token $RAILWAY_TOKEN
```

**After:**
```bash
echo $RAILWAY_TOKEN | railway login
```

## Status
- ✅ Fixed GitHub Actions workflow
- ✅ Updated authentication method for Railway CLI
- ✅ Deployment should now work correctly

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push the updated workflow file
2. GitHub Actions will automatically deploy to Railway
3. pinauth.com should receive the proper build files
